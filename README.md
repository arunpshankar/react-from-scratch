# ReAct from scratch

This repo compiles a collection of examples that demonstrate the effective use of the ReAct pattern in LLM prompting. It includes variations and implementations of agents that leverage the ReAct pattern, optimized for Gemini.


git clone repo 

cd repo

create venv 
python -m venv .react-from-scratch 


source .react-from-scratch/bin/activate 


pip install --upgrade pip

pip install - r requirements.txt

this basically installs pipx which we need to use with poetry 
Pipx installs packages in isolated environments, while pip does not. This prevents conflicts among Python programs that share dependencies
