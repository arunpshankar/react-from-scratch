  "summary": "Kamala Devi Harris (born October 20, 1964) is an American politician and attorney who has been the 49th and current vice president of the United States since 2021, serving under President Joe Biden. She is the first woman, the first African American, and the first Asian American to be vice president. She is the highest-ranking female official in U.S. history. Harris is the Democratic Party's nominee for president in the 2024 election. From 2017 to 2021, she represented California in the United States Senate. Before that, she was the attorney general of California.\nBorn in Oakland, California, Harris graduated from Howard University and the University of California's Hastings College of the Law. She began her law career in the office of the district attorney of Alameda County. She was recruited to the San Francisco District Attorney's Office and later to the office of the city attorney of San Francisco. She was elected district attorney of San Francisco in 2003 and attorney general of California in 2010, and reelected as attorney general in 2014. As the San Francisco district attorney and the attorney general of California, Harris was the first woman, the first African American, and the first Asian American to hold each office.\nHarris was the junior U.S. senator from California from 2017 to 2021. She won the 2016 Senate election, becoming the second Black woman and first South Asian American U.S. senator. As a senator, Harris advocated for stricter gun control laws, the DREAM Act, federal legalization of cannabis, and reforms to healthcare and taxation. She gained a national profile for her pointed questioning of Trump administration officials during Senate hearings, including Trump's second Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.\nHarris sought the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination in 2019, but withdrew from the race before the primaries. Biden selected her as his running mate, and their ticket defeated the incumbent president and vice president, Donald Trump and Mike Pence, in the 2020 election. Presiding over an evenly split Senate upon entering office, Harris played a crucial role as president of the Senate. She cast more tie-breaking votes than any other vice president, which helped pass bills such as the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 stimulus package and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. After Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential election, Harris launched her campaign with Biden's endorsement. On August 6, 2024, she chose Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, as her running mate."

  "title": "Tulsi Gabbard",
  "summary": "Tulsi Gabbard ( TUL-see GAB-É™rd; born April 12, 1981) is an American politician, United States Army Reserve officer, and conservative political commentator who served as U.S. Representative for Hawaii's 2nd congressional district from 2013 to 2021. She became the first Samoan-American voting member of Congress. A then-member of the Democratic Party, she was  a candidate for its nomination in the 2020 United States presidential election; she left the party in October 2022 to become an independent politician.\nIn 2002, Gabbard was elected to the Hawaii House of Representatives at the age of 21. Gabbard served in a field medical unit of the Hawaii Army National Guard while deployed to Iraq from 2004 to 2005 and was stationed in Kuwait from 2008 to 2009 as an Army Military Police platoon leader. While a member of Congress, she served as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) from 2013 to 2016, and resigned to endorse Bernie Sanders' campaign for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.\nDuring her time in Congress, she frequently appeared on Fox News and criticized the Barack Obama administration for refusing to say that the real enemy of the United States is radical Islam or Islamic extremism. During her presidential campaign, she highlighted an opposition to military interventionism, although she has contradicted that and called herself a \"hawk\" on combatting terrorism. Her decision to meet Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and her skepticism of claims that he had used chemical weapons gave rise to public disagreement with mainstream Democrats. In March 2020, Gabbard ended her presidential candidacy, and endorsed Joe Biden over her former ally Bernie Sanders.\nSince leaving the House of Representatives on January 3, 2021, Gabbard has taken more conservative positions on issues such as abortion, foreign policy, transgender rights, and border security. She has continued her frequent presence on Fox News, including serving as a fill-in host for Tucker Carlson Tonight. In October 2022, Gabbard announced that she had left the Democratic Party altogether, citing their positions on foreign policy and social issues as reasons for her departure. Gabbard campaigned for several Republican candidates in the 2022 midterm elections. She was also a featured speaker at the 2022 and 2024 Conservative Political Action Conferences (CPAC). In 2024, Gabbard endorsed former President Donald Trump for the 2024 United States presidential election."
